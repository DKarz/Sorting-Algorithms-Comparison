# Sorting-Algorithms-Comparison
This the second homework from the "Introduction to C++" course that was accomplished by me during my first year at my university.
## Brief report about problem 2  	 	 
All the data is generated by special functions. The collections consist either from integers or strings at most of length three digits or 20 letters (both small and capitals) respectively. All the plots are drawn by python using matplotlib library. The horizontal axis represents the size of the array/list/vector. The vertical axis shows the time of sorting. 

As the graphs shows, all the algorithms have different behavior depending on the data structure is sorted. Merge sort algorithm is ranked first among Insertion sort and Quick sort. Quick sort works with lists faster than Insertion sort. However, the latter is more efficient with sorting arrays. 

Also, Counting sort and Radix sort are compared together in sorting of vectors of integers. Despite the fact that there are some points where Counting sort is quicker, on average Radix sort sorted a given vector with higher efficiency. 
 
Examples of the data which was sorted:  
```{ 503, 787, 671, 812, 253, 1152, 844, 1095, 130 } ```

```{ hDajBb, fA, fc, DhFB, cBgbCJE, AaaJhA , dJ, i, dbCfIc } ```
